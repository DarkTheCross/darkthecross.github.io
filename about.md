Always curious about new technologies, and interested in reality-related interactions, including robotics, robot perception, intelligent devices etc.

~~Was once very athletic. Good at cooking. Play Dota2.~~

Studied at Tsinghua University (2011-2015) and the University of Michigan (2016-2018).

Worked at Mechmind Robotics as a Robot Algorithm Engieer, and is now working for Google as a Software Engineer on the Google Apps team. Not open to new positions, but would be glad to make new connections.
