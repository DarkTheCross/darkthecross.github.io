                I recently bought an RTX 3090 graphics card. It has 24G memory, which should be able to handle STOA CNNs in 2016 or 2017. So why don't us feed a lot of images 
                to this beast and let it learn something...

                A good thing to try is super resolution for videos. Some videos, especially old ones, are often of bad resolution, and if we can recover them with ML models, it 
                would be great.

                The network structure was based on this <a class="text-muted" href="http://krasserm.github.io/2019/09/04/super-resolution/" target="_blank">webpage</a>, which has ~300k params. 
                Let's try on a single image first...
            </p>
            <p>
                Turned out that the trained model was able to recover the image slightly better than cubic interpolation...

                Well, we should also try if this works with video. Feeding 5 consecutive frames into the neural network... (See github for network details). And it did not work, the error was even larger 
                than recovering from a single image, and that's bad. For ML systems, it happends.
