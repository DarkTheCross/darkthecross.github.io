                It would be super cool to implement some algorithm on real hardware! Thus I bought a toolkit for 
                a balance car from <a href="https://miaowlabs.com/" target="_blank" class="text-muted">MiaoWLab</a> and started building a balance car. 
                The first step would definitely be testing the algorithm in simulation. I created the URDF file for the balance car, 
                and tested (and tuned) my PID control algorithm with pybullet.

                The next step is to implement the algorithm in C, and upload it to the embedded system. Yes, raw C, yes,
                 upload through Keli, into a C51-like single chip microcomputer. Luckily, with the IMU and the pre-defined 
                 control interface for the wheels, it was not super hard to do this. And it worked!
