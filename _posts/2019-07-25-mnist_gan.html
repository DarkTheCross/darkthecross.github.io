                Generative Adversarial Network is really a cool stuff, enabling human to use machine
                learning to generate a series of images, which are merely distinguishable from some real
                images.

                This project is just a toy project for GAN. I'm building a generative neural network and
                 a discriminative neural network, to automatically generate a MNIST image which represents
                 number 9.
